# Attention to Detail | Painting & Decorating Services

- For this application, i'm building a site for my friends painting & decorating business and trying to integrate new technologies while making a site that represents him and his business well!
- I made a big focus on getting SEO, accessibilty & best practices to 100 in lighthouse and i feel i have learnt a lot from it! Rather than just publishing a site, there is a lot to learn about making the site accessible for everyone!
- Another problem i had was the image sizing was too big and making the performance of the site slow, i had to optimize all of the images which made a massive impact taking it from under 20 performace to over 70. I would like to get this into the 90's but this was a massive change to how it was running in the first instance.
- The logo was created and all images were edited through Canva and i have been utilizing this more and more.
